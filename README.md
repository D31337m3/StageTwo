# StageTwo
ESP32-S3 Second Stage Bootloader with GFX and Menu + APP Launcher w/ web interface(remote access/development) + Recovery/Backup System!
__________________________________________________

This repo marks the home of the ESP32-S3 based (may work with other beefier ESP models pending sufficient storage and ram, as well
as available circuitpython libraries, as well as functionaly available firmware** 

Sidenotes:
  * This project was build ontop of circuitpython source code written by Adafruit Industries.  https://github.com/adafruit
  * Many of the features in this project were initially also enabled by the ease and abundance of adafruit libraries and the fact they
    - are open source allowed me to further development/customize some of the code to achieve very specific end games. So pretty much
    - this is frankenstiened code that is now being refined into a final dream project of mine, that i courageously share with you now.

  * This project was initially only written and design factored with one device in mind. The "ESP32-S3-GEEK" by Waveshare (links bottom of page).
  * THe ESP32-s3-GEEK, is one of Waveshares higher end offerings built on Espressifs ESP32-S3 platform.  Currently packs 16MB of FLASH, 8MB or PSRAM
    dual core, with threading *** NOT in circuit python firmware unfortunatly** at 240MHz per core. Wifi,BLE and USB Type A(male) with many modes to
    choose from (USB-MSC, USB-HID, USB-MIDI, USB-CDC etc...) and of course an Built in SDcard reader and built in Tft Display, with 3 seperate IO ports
    specifically chosen for their UART, I2C, and 3 GPIO pins, alotting a total of 7 Useable pins 2 of which allow 3.3v power to/from the device.
  * Based on its current design, the device as shipped is intended to be a development and learning platform in which you code and develop your own
    hardware debugging and interface device. Think USB-Serial probes, UART interfaces, serial port monitors, hardware testing etc. This is where
    my inspiration takes off.

    Sick of having to do every design change or creative direction destructively and rewritting  some files so many times in the process i decided
    to come up with STAGE-TWO.
